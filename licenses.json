(This package is planned to eventually move to\n`@webcomponents/ssr-dom-shim` to better reflect this use case). There are two\nmain patterns for providing access to these shims to users:\n\n1. Assigning shims to `globalThis`, ensuring that assignment occurs before\n   user-code runs.\n\n2. Importing shims directly from the module that provides your base class, using\n   the `node` [export\n   condition](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports) to\n   ensure this only happens when running in Node, and not in the browser.\n\nLit takes approach #2 for all of the shims except for `customElements`, so that\nusers who have imported `lit` are able to call `customElements.define` in their\ncomponents from Node.\n\n### Exports\n\nThe main module exports the following values. Note that no globals are set by\nthis module.\n\n- [`Element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element)\n  - [`attachShadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow)\n  - [`shadowRoot`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/shadowRoot)\n  - [`attributes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attributes)\n  - [`hasAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/hasAttribute)\n  - [`getAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getAttribute)\n  - [`setAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute)\n  - [`removeAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/removeAttribute)\n- [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)\n  - (Inherits from Element)\n- [`CustomElementRegistry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry)\n- [`customElements`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/customElements)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).",

If\r\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\r\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\r\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license.

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\r\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\r\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\r\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\r\n\r\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\r\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\r\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\n\r\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\r\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\r\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\r\n     categorized.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\r\n     under this Public License.\r\n\r\n  i.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\r\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 2 -- Scope.\r\n\r\n  a. License grant.\r\n\r\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\r\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\r\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\n\r\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\r\n               in part; and\r\n\r\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\r\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\r\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\r\n          its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\r\n          6(a).\r\n\r\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\r\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\r\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\r\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\r\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\r\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\r\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\r\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\r\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\r\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\r\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       5. Downstream recipients.\r\n\r\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\r\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\r\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\r\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\r\n               Public License.\r\n\r\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\r\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\r\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\r\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\r\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\r\n               Material.\r\n\r\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\r\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\r\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\r\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\r\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\r\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\n  b. Other rights.\r\n\r\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\r\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\r\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\r\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\r\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\r\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\r\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\r\n          Public License.\r\n\r\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\r\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\r\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\r\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\r\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\r\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\r\n\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\r\nfollowing conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. Attribution.\r\n\r\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\r\n          form), You must:\r\n\r\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\r\n               with the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\r\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\r\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\r\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\r\n                    designated);\r\n\r\n                ii. a copyright notice;\r\n\r\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\r\n\r\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\r\n                    warranties;\r\n\r\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\r\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\r\n\r\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\r\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\n\r\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\r\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\r\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\n\r\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\r\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\r\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\r\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\r\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\r\n          information.\r\n\r\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\r\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\r\n          reasonably practicable.\r\n\r\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\r\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\r\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\r\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\r\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\r\n     portion of the contents of the database;\r\n\r\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\r\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\r\n\r\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\r\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\r\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\r\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\r\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\r\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\r\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\r\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\r\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\r\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\r\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\r\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\r\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\r\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\r\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\r\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\r\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\r\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\r\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\r\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\r\n     waiver of all liability.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\r\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\r\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\r\n     terminate automatically.\r\n\r\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\r\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\r\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\r\n          violation; or\r\n\r\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\n\r\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\r\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\r\n     of this Public License.\r\n\r\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\r\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\r\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\r\n     will not terminate this Public License.\r\n\r\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\r\n     License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\r\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\n\r\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\r\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\r\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\r\n\r\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\r\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\r\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\r\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\r\n\r\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\r\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\r\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\r\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\r\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\r\n     conditions.\r\n\r\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\r\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\r\n     Licensor.\r\n\r\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\r\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\r\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\r\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================================================================\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\r\nlicenses.

That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

        "licenseTxt": "# assert-plus\n\nThis library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two\nthings: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable\nNODE\\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like\n`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n        assert.object(options, 'options');\n        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');\n        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n        assert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n        callback(null, {});\n    }\n```\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n```javascript\n    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');\n```\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are\nalso disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from\nthe `assert` module avoids this behavior.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.array\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.finite\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.stream\n* assert.date\n* assert.regexp\n* assert.uuid\n* assert.arrayOfArray\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfBuffer\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfFinite\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.arrayOfStream\n* assert.arrayOfDate\n* assert.arrayOfRegexp\n* assert.arrayOfUuid\n* assert.optionalArray\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalFinite\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalStream\n* assert.optionalDate\n* assert.optionalRegexp\n* assert.optionalUuid\n* assert.optionalArrayOfArray\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfStream\n* assert.optionalArrayOfDate\n* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp\n* assert.optionalArrayOfUuid\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Options in the object will override any present in the url. Options will fall back to the same environment variables as psql.\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres('postgres://username:password@host:port/database', {\n  host                 : '',            // Postgres ip address[s] or domain name[s]\n  port                 : 5432,          // Postgres server port[s]\n  database             : '',            // Name of database to connect to\n  username             : '',            // Username of database user\n  password             : '',            // Password of database user\n  ...and more\n})\n```\n\nMore options can be found in the [Connection details section](#connection-details).\n\n## Queries\n\n### ```await sql`...` -> Result[]```\n\nPostgres.js utilizes [Tagged template functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates) to process query parameters **before** interpolation. Using tagged template literals benefits developers by:\n\n1. **Enforcing** safe query generation\n2. Giving the ` sql`` ` function powerful [utility](#dynamic-inserts) and [query building](#building-queries) features.\n\nAny generic value will be serialized according to an inferred type, and replaced by a PostgreSQL protocol placeholder `$1, $2, ...`. The parameters are then sent separately to the database which handles escaping & casting.\n\nAll queries will return a `Result` array, with objects mapping column names to each row.\n\n```js\nconst xs = await sql`\n  insert into users (\n    name, age\n  ) values (\n    'Murray', 68\n  )\n\n  returning *\n`\n\n// xs = [{ user_id: 1, name: 'Murray', age: 68 }]\n```\n\n> Please note that queries are first executed when `awaited` – or instantly by using [`.execute()`](#execute).\n\n### Query parameters\n\nParameters are automatically extracted and handled by the database so that SQL injection isn't possible. No special handling is necessary, simply use tagged template literals as usual.\n\n```js\nconst name = 'Mur'\n    , age = 60\n\nconst users = await sql`\n  select\n    name,\n    age\n  from users\n  where\n    name like ${ name + '%' }\n    and age > ${ age }\n`\n// users = [{ name: 'Murray', age: 68 }]\n```\n\n> Be careful with quotation marks here. Because Postgres infers column types, you do not need to wrap your interpolated parameters in quotes like `'${name}'`. This will cause an error because the tagged template replaces `${name}` with `$1` in the query string, leaving Postgres to do the interpolation. If you wrap that in a string, Postgres will see `'$1'` and interpret it as a string as opposed to a parameter.\n\n### Dynamic column selection\n\n```js\nconst columns = ['name', 'age']\n\nawait sql`\n  select\n    ${ sql(columns) }\n  from users\n`\n\n// Which results in:\nselect \"name\", \"age\" from users\n```\n\n### Dynamic inserts\n\n```js\nconst user = {\n  name: 'Murray',\n  age: 68\n}\n\nawait sql`\n  insert into users ${\n    sql(user, 'name', 'age')\n  }\n`\n\n// Which results in:\ninsert into users (\"name\", \"age\") values ($1, $2)\n\n// The columns can also be given with an array\nconst columns = ['name', 'age']\n\nawait sql`\n  insert into users ${\n    sql(user, columns)\n  }\n`\n```\n\n**You can omit column names and simply execute `sql(user)` to get all the fields from the object as columns**. Be careful not to allow users to supply columns that you do not want to be inserted.\n\n#### Multiple inserts in one query\nIf you need to insert multiple rows at the same time it's also much faster to do it with a single `insert`. Simply pass an array of objects to `sql()`.\n\n```js\nconst users = [{\n  name: 'Murray',\n  age: 68,\n  garbage: 'ignore'\n},\n{\n  name: 'Walter',\n  age: 80\n}]\n\nawait sql`insert into users ${ sql(users, 'name', 'age') }`\n\n// Is translated to:\ninsert into users (\"name\", \"age\") values ($1, $2), ($3, $4)\n\n// Here you can also omit column names which will use object keys as columns\nawait sql`insert into users ${ sql(users) }`\n\n// Which results in:\ninsert into users (\"name\", \"age\") values ($1, $2), ($3, $4)\n```\n\n### Dynamic columns in updates\nThis is also useful for update queries\n```js\nconst user = {\n  id: 1,\n  name: 'Murray',\n  age: 68\n}\n\nawait sql`\n  update users set ${\n    sql(user, 'name', 'age')\n  }\n  where user_id = ${ user.id }\n`\n\n// Which results in:\nupdate users set \"name\" = $1, \"age\" = $2 where user_id = $3\n\n// The columns can also be given with an array\nconst columns = ['name', 'age']\n\nawait sql`\n  update users set ${\n    sql(user, columns)\n  }\n  where user_id = ${ user.id }\n`\n```\n\n### Multiple updates in one query\nTo create multiple updates in a single query, it is necessary to use arrays instead of objects to ensure that the order of the items correspond with the column names.\n```js\nconst users = [\n  [1, 'John', 34],\n  [2, 'Jane', 27],\n]\n\nawait sql`\n  update users set name = update_data.name, age = (update_data.age)::int\n  from (values ${sql(users)}) as update_data (id, name, age)\n  where users.id = (update_data.id)::int\n  returning users.id, users.name, users.age\n`\n```\n\n### Dynamic values and `where in`\nValue lists can also be created dynamically, making `where in` queries simple too.\n```js\nconst users = await sql`\n  select\n    *\n  from users\n  where age in ${ sql([68, 75, 23]) }\n`\n```\n\nor\n```js\nconst [{ a, b, c }] = await sql`\n  select\n    *\n  from (values ${ sql(['a', 'b', 'c']) }) as x(a, b, c)\n`\n```\n\n## Building queries\n\nPostgres.js features a simple dynamic query builder by conditionally appending/omitting query fragments.\nIt works by nesting ` sql`` ` fragments within other ` sql`` ` calls or fragments. This allows you to build dynamic queries safely without risking sql injections through usual string concatenation.\n\n### Partial queries\n```js\nconst olderThan = x => sql`and age > ${ x }`\n\nconst filterAge = true\n\nawait sql`\n  select\n   *\n  from users\n  where name is not null ${\n    filterAge\n      ? olderThan(50)\n      : sql``\n  }\n`\n// Which results in:\nselect * from users where name is not null\n// Or\nselect * from users where name is not null and age > 50\n```\n\n### Dynamic filters\n```js\nawait sql`\n  select\n    *\n  from users ${\n    id\n      ? sql`where user_id = ${ id }`\n      : sql``\n  }\n`\n\n// Which results in:\nselect * from users\n// Or\nselect * from users where user_id = $1\n```\n\n### SQL functions\nUsing keywords or calling functions dynamically is also possible by using ``` sql`` ``` fragments.\n```js\nconst date = null\n\nawait sql`\n  update users set updated_at = ${ date || sql`now()` }\n`\n\n// Which results in:\nupdate users set updated_at = now()\n```\n\n### Table names\nDynamic identifiers like table names and column names is also supported like so:\n```js\nconst table = 'users'\n    , column = 'id'\n\nawait sql`\n  select ${ sql(column) } from ${ sql(table) }\n`\n\n// Which results in:\nselect \"id\" from \"users\"\n```\n\n### Quick primer on interpolation\n\nHere's a quick oversight over all the ways to do interpolation in a query template string:\n\n| Interpolation syntax       | Usage                         | Example                                                   |\n| -------------              | -------------                 | -------------                                             |\n| `${ sql`` }`               | for keywords or sql fragments | ``await sql`SELECT * FROM users ${sql`order by age desc` }` ``  |\n| `${ sql(string) }`         | for identifiers               | ``await sql`SELECT * FROM ${sql('table_name')` ``               |\n| `${ sql([] or {}, ...) }`  | for helpers                   | ``await sql`INSERT INTO users ${sql({ name: 'Peter'})}` ``      |\n| `${ 'somevalue' }`         | for values                    | ``await sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = ${42}` ``           |\n\n## Advanced query methods\n\n### Cursors\n\n#### ```await sql``.cursor([rows = 1], [fn])```\n\nUse cursors if you need to throttle the amount of rows being returned from a query. You can use a cursor either as an [async iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) or with a callback function. For a callback function new results won't be requested until the promise / async callback function has resolved.\n\n##### callback function\n```js\nawait sql`\n  select\n    *\n  from generate_series(1,4) as x\n`.cursor(async([row]) => {\n  // row = { x: 1 }\n  await http.request('https://example.com/wat', { row })\n})\n```\n\n##### for await...of\n```js\n// for await...of\nconst cursor = sql`select * from generate_series(1,4) as x`.cursor()\n\nfor await (const [row] of cursor) {\n  // row = { x: 1 }\n  await http.request('https://example.com/wat', { row })\n}\n```\n\nA single row will be returned by default, but you can also request batches by setting the number of rows desired in each batch as the first argument to `.cursor`:\n```js\nawait sql`\n  select\n    *\n  from generate_series(1,1000) as x\n`.cursor(10, async rows => {\n  // rows = [{ x: 1 }, { x: 2 }, ... ]\n  await Promise.all(rows.map(row =>\n    http.request('https://example.com/wat', { row })\n  ))\n})\n```\n\nIf an error is thrown inside the callback function no more rows will be requested and the outer promise will reject with the thrown error.\n\nYou can close the cursor early either by calling `break` in the `for await...of` loop, or by returning the token `sql.CLOSE` from the callback function.\n\n```js\nawait sql`\n  select * from generate_series(1,1000) as x\n`.cursor(row => {\n  return Math.random() > 0.9 && sql.CLOSE // or sql.END\n})\n```\n\n### Instant iteration\n\n#### ```await sql``.forEach(fn)```\n\nIf you want to handle rows returned by a query one by one, you can use `.forEach` which returns a promise that resolves once there are no more rows.\n```js\nawait sql`\n  select created_at, name from events\n`.forEach(row => {\n  // row = { created_at: '2019-11-22T14:22:00Z', name: 'connected' }\n})\n\n// No more rows\n```\n\n### Query Descriptions\n#### ```await sql``.describe() -> Result[]```\n\nRather than executing a given query, `.describe` will return information utilized in the query process. This information can include the query identifier, column types, etc.\n\nThis is useful for debugging and analyzing your Postgres queries. Furthermore, **`.describe` will give you access to the final generated query string that would be executed.**\n\n### Rows as Array of Values\n#### ```sql``.values()```\n\nUsing `.values` will return rows as an array of values for each column, instead of objects.\n\nThis can be useful to receive identically named columns, or for specific performance/transformation reasons. The column definitions are still included on the result array, plus access to parsers for each column.\n\n### Rows as Raw Array of Buffers\n#### ```sql``.raw()```\n\nUsing `.raw` will return rows as an array with `Buffer` values for each column, instead of objects.\n\nThis can be useful for specific performance/transformation reasons. The column definitions are still included on the result array, plus access to parsers for each column.\n\n### Queries in Files\n#### `await sql.file(path, [args], [options]) -> Result[]`\n\nUsing a file for a query is also supported with optional parameters to use if the file includes `$1, $2, etc`\n\n```js\nconst result = await sql.file('query.sql', ['Murray', 68])\n```\n\n### Multiple statements in one query\n#### ```await sql``.simple()```\n\nThe postgres wire protocol supports [\"simple\"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#id-1.10.6.7.4) and [\"extended\"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-EXT-QUERY) queries. \"simple\" queries supports multiple statements, but does not support any dynamic parameters. \"extended\" queries support parameters but only one statement. To use \"simple\" queries you can use\n```sql``.simple()```. That will create it as a simple query.\n\n```js\nawait sql`select 1; select 2;`.simple()\n```\n\n### Copy to/from as Streams\n\nPostgres.js supports [`COPY ...`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-copy.html) queries, which are exposed as [Node.js streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html).\n\n#### ```await sql`copy ... from stdin`.writable() -> Writable```\n\n```js\nimport { pipeline } from 'node:stream/promises'\n\n// Stream of users with the default tab delimitated cells and new-line delimitated rows\nconst userStream = Readable.from([\n  'Murray\\t68\\n',\n  'Walter\\t80\\n'\n])\n\nconst query = await sql`copy users (name, age) from stdin`.writable()\nawait pipeline(userStream, query);\n```\n\n#### ```await sql`copy ... to stdout`.readable() -> Readable```\n\n##### Using Stream Pipeline\n```js\nimport { pipeline } from 'node:stream/promises'\nimport { createWriteStream } from 'node:fs'\n\nconst readableStream = await sql`copy users (name, age) to stdout`.readable()\nawait pipeline(readableStream, createWriteStream('output.tsv'))\n// output.tsv content: `Murray\\t68\\nWalter\\t80\\n`\n```\n\n##### Using `for await...of`\n```js\nconst readableStream = await sql`\n  copy (\n    select name, age\n    from users\n    where age = 68\n  ) to stdout\n`.readable()\nfor await (const chunk of readableStream) {\n  // chunk.toString() === `Murray\\t68\\n`\n}\n```\n\n> **NOTE** This is a low-level API which does not provide any type safety. To make this work, you must match your [`copy query` parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-copy.html) correctly to your [Node.js stream read or write](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) code. Ensure [Node.js stream backpressure](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/backpressuring-in-streams/) is handled correctly to avoid memory exhaustion.\n\n### Canceling Queries in Progress\n\nPostgres.js supports, [canceling queries in progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.1/protocol-protocol.html#AEN39000). It works by opening a new connection with a protocol level startup message to cancel the current query running on a specific connection. That means there is no guarantee that the query will be canceled, and due to the possible race conditions it might even result in canceling another query. This is fine for long running queries, but in the case of high load and fast queries it might be better to simply ignore results instead of canceling.\n\n```js\nconst query = sql`select pg_sleep 100`.execute()\nsetTimeout(() => query.cancel(), 100)\nconst result = await query\n```\n\n### Execute\n\n#### ```await sql``.execute()```\n\nThe lazy Promise implementation in Postgres.js is what allows it to distinguish [Nested Fragments](#building-queries) from the main outer query. This also means that queries are always executed at the earliest in the following tick. If you have a specific need to execute the query in the same tick, you can call `.execute()`\n\n### Unsafe raw string queries\n\n<details>\n<summary>Advanced unsafe use cases</summary>\n\n### `await sql.unsafe(query, [args], [options]) -> Result[]`\n\nIf you know what you're doing, you can use `unsafe` to pass any string you'd like to postgres. Please note that this can lead to SQL injection if you're not careful.\n\n```js\nsql.unsafe('select ' + danger + ' from users where id = ' + dragons)\n```\n\nYou can also nest `sql.unsafe` within a safe `sql` expression.  This is useful if only part of your fraction has unsafe elements.\n\n```js\nconst triggerName = 'friend_created'\nconst triggerFnName = 'on_friend_created'\nconst eventType = 'insert'\nconst schema_name = 'app'\nconst table_name = 'friends'\n\nawait sql`\n  create or replace trigger ${sql(triggerName)}\n  after ${sql.unsafe(eventType)} on ${sql.unsafe(`${schema_name}.${table_name}`)}\n  for each row\n  execute function ${sql(triggerFnName)}()\n`\n\nawait sql`\n  create role friend_service with login password ${sql.unsafe(`'${password}'`)}\n`\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Transactions\n\n#### BEGIN / COMMIT `await sql.begin([options = ''], fn) -> fn()`\n\nUse `sql.begin` to start a new transaction. Postgres.js will reserve a connection for the transaction and supply a scoped `sql` instance for all transaction uses in the callback function. `sql.begin` will resolve with the returned value from the callback function.\n\n`BEGIN` is automatically sent with the optional options, and if anything fails `ROLLBACK` will be called so the connection can be released and execution can continue.\n\n```js\nconst [user, account] = await sql.begin(async sql => {\n  const [user] = await sql`\n    insert into users (\n      name\n    ) values (\n      'Murray'\n    )\n    returning *\n  `\n\n  const [account] = await sql`\n    insert into accounts (\n      user_id\n    ) values (\n      ${ user.user_id }\n    )\n    returning *\n  `\n\n  return [user, account]\n})\n```\n\nDo note that you can often achieve the same result using [`WITH` queries (Common Table Expressions)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html) instead of using transactions.\n\nIt's also possible to pipeline the requests in a transaction if needed by returning an array with queries from the callback function like this:\n\n```js\nconst result = await sql.begin(sql => [\n  sql`update ...`,\n  sql`update ...`,\n  sql`insert ...`\n])\n```\n\n#### SAVEPOINT `await sql.savepoint([name], fn) -> fn()`\n\n```js\nsql.begin('read write', async sql => {\n  const [user] = await sql`\n    insert into users (\n      name\n    ) values (\n      'Murray'\n    )\n  `\n\n  const [account] = (await sql.savepoint(sql =>\n    sql`\n      insert into accounts (\n        user_id\n      ) values (\n        ${ user.user_id }\n      )\n    `\n  ).catch(err => {\n    // Account could not be created. ROLLBACK SAVEPOINT is called because we caught the rejection.\n  })) || []\n\n  return [user, account]\n})\n.then(([user, account]) => {\n  // great success - COMMIT succeeded\n})\n.catch(() => {\n  // not so good - ROLLBACK was called\n})\n```\n\n\n#### PREPARE TRANSACTION `await sql.prepare([name]) -> fn()`\n\nIndicates that the transactions should be prepared using the [`PREPARE TRANSACTION [NAME]`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare-transaction.html) statement\ninstead of being committed.\n\n```js\nsql.begin('read write', async sql => {\n  const [user] = await sql`\n    insert into users (\n      name\n    ) values (\n      'Murray'\n    )\n  `\n\n  await sql.prepare('tx1')\n})\n```\n\n## Data Transformation\n\nPostgres.js allows for transformation of the data passed to or returned from a query by using the `transform` option.\n\nBuilt in transformation functions are:\n\n* For camelCase - `postgres.camel`, `postgres.toCamel`, `postgres.fromCamel`\n* For PascalCase - `postgres.pascal`, `postgres.toPascal`, `postgres.fromPascal`\n* For Kebab-Case - `postgres.kebab`, `postgres.toKebab`, `postgres.fromKebab`\n\nThese built in transformations will only convert to/from snake_case. For example, using `{ transform: postgres.toCamel }` will convert the column names to camelCase only if the column names are in snake_case to begin with. `{ transform: postgres.fromCamel }` will convert camelCase only to snake_case.\n\nBy default, using `postgres.camel`, `postgres.pascal` and `postgres.kebab` will perform a two-way transformation - both the data passed to the query and the data returned by the query will be transformed:\n\n```js\n// Transform the column names to and from camel case\nconst sql = postgres({ transform: postgres.camel })\n\nawait sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS camel_case (a_test INTEGER, b_test TEXT)`\nawait sql`INSERT INTO camel_case ${ sql([{ aTest: 1, bTest: 1 }]) }`\nconst data = await sql`SELECT ${ sql('aTest', 'bTest') } FROM camel_case`\n\nconsole.log(data) // [ { aTest: 1, bTest: '1' } ]\n```\n\nTo only perform half of the transformation (eg. only the transformation **to** or **from** camel case), use the other transformation functions:\n\n```js\n// Transform the column names only to camel case\n// (for the results that are returned from the query)\npostgres({ transform: postgres.toCamel })\n\nawait sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS camel_case (a_test INTEGER)`\nawait sql`INSERT INTO camel_case ${ sql([{ a_test: 1 }]) }`\nconst data = await sql`SELECT a_test FROM camel_case`\n\nconsole.log(data) // [ { aTest: 1 } ]\n```\n\n```js\n// Transform the column names only from camel case\n// (for interpolated inserts, updates, and selects)\nconst sql = postgres({ transform: postgres.fromCamel })\n\nawait sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS camel_case (a_test INTEGER)`\nawait sql`INSERT INTO camel_case ${ sql([{ aTest: 1 }]) }`\nconst data = await sql`SELECT ${ sql('aTest') } FROM camel_case`\n\nconsole.log(data) // [ { a_test: 1 } ]\n```\n\n> Note that Postgres.js does not rewrite the static parts of the tagged template strings. So to transform column names in your queries, the `sql()` helper must be used - eg. `${ sql('columnName') }` as in the examples above.\n\n### Transform `undefined` Values\n\nBy default, Postgres.js will throw the error `UNDEFINED_VALUE: Undefined values are not allowed` when undefined values are passed\n\n```js\n// Transform the column names to and from camel case\nconst sql = postgres({\n  transform: {\n    undefined: null\n  }\n})\n\nawait sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transform_undefined (a_test INTEGER)`\nawait sql`INSERT INTO transform_undefined ${ sql([{ a_test: undefined }]) }`\nconst data = await sql`SELECT a_test FROM transform_undefined`\n\nconsole.log(data) // [ { a_test: null } ]\n```\n\nTo combine with the built in transform functions, spread the transform in the `transform` object:\n\n```js\n// Transform the column names to and from camel case\nconst sql = postgres({\n  transform: {\n    ...postgres.camel,\n    undefined: null\n  }\n})\n\nawait sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transform_undefined (a_test INTEGER)`\nawait sql`INSERT INTO transform_undefined ${ sql([{ aTest: undefined }]) }`\nconst data = await sql`SELECT ${ sql('aTest') } FROM transform_undefined`\n\nconsole.log(data) // [ { aTest: null } ]\n```\n\n### Custom Transform Functions\n\nTo specify your own transformation functions, you can use the `column`, `value` and `row` options inside of `transform`, each an object possibly including `to` and `from` keys:\n\n* `to`: The function to transform the outgoing query column name to, i.e `SELECT ${ sql('aName') }` to `SELECT a_name` when using `postgres.toCamel`.\n* `from`: The function to transform the incoming query result column name to, see example below.\n\n> Both parameters are optional, if not provided, the default transformation function will be used.\n\n```js\n// Implement your own functions, look at postgres.toCamel, etc\n// as a reference:\n// https://github.com/porsager/postgres/blob/4241824ffd7aa94ffb482e54ca9f585d9d0a4eea/src/types.js#L310-L328\nfunction transformColumnToDatabase() { /* ... */ }\nfunction transformColumnFromDatabase() { /* ... */ }\n\nconst sql = postgres({\n  transform: {\n    column: {\n      to: transformColumnToDatabase,\n      from: transformColumnFromDatabase,\n    },\n    value: { /* ... */ },\n    row: { /* ... */ }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Listen & notify\n\nWhen you call `.listen`, a dedicated connection will be created to ensure that you receive notifications instantly. This connection will be used for any further calls to `.listen`. The connection will automatically reconnect according to a backoff reconnection pattern to not overload the database server.\n\n### Listen `await sql.listen(channel, onnotify, [onlisten]) -> { state }`\n`.listen` takes the channel name, a function to handle each notify, and an optional function to run every time listen is registered and ready (happens on initial connect and reconnects). It returns a promise which resolves once the `LISTEN` query to Postgres completes, or if there is already a listener active.\n\n```js\nawait sql.listen('news', payload => {\n  const json = JSON.parse(payload)\n  console.log(json.this) // logs 'is'\n})\n```\n\nThe optional `onlisten` method is great to use for a very simply queue mechanism:\n\n```js\nawait sql.listen(\n  'jobs',\n  (x) => run(JSON.parse(x)),\n  ( ) => sql`select unfinished_jobs()`.forEach(run)\n)\n\nfunction run(job) {\n  // And here you do the work you please\n}\n```\n### Notify `await sql.notify(channel, payload) -> Result[]`\nNotify can be done as usual in SQL, or by using the `sql.notify` method.\n```js\nsql.notify('news', JSON.stringify({ no: 'this', is: 'news' }))\n```\n\n## Realtime subscribe\n\nPostgres.js implements the logical replication protocol of PostgreSQL to support subscription to real-time updates of `insert`, `update` and `delete` operations.\n\n> **NOTE** To make this work you must [create the proper publications in your database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html), enable logical replication by setting `wal_level = logical` in `postgresql.conf` and connect using either a replication or superuser.\n\n### Quick start\n\n#### Create a publication (eg. in migration)\n```sql\nCREATE PUBLICATION alltables FOR ALL TABLES\n```\n\n#### Subscribe to updates\n```js\nconst sql = postgres({ publications: 'alltables' })\n\nconst { unsubscribe } = await sql.subscribe(\n  'insert:events',\n  (row, { command, relation, key, old }) => {\n    // Callback function for each row change\n    // tell about new event row over eg. websockets or do something else\n  },\n  () => {\n    // Callback on initial connect and potential reconnects\n  }\n)\n```\n\n### Subscribe pattern\n\nYou can subscribe to specific operations, tables, or even rows with primary keys.\n\n#### `operation`      `:` `schema` `.` `table` `=` `primary_key`\n\n**`operation`** is one of ``` * | insert | update | delete ``` and defaults to `*`\n\n**`schema`** defaults to `public`\n\n**`table`** is a specific table name and defaults to `*`\n\n**`primary_key`** can be used to only subscribe to specific rows\n\n### Examples\n\n```js\nsql.subscribe('*',                () => /* everything */ )\nsql.subscribe('insert',           () => /* all inserts */ )\nsql.subscribe('*:users',          () => /* all operations on the public.users table */ )\nsql.subscribe('delete:users',     () => /* all deletes on the public.users table */ )\nsql.subscribe('update:users=1',   () => /* all updates on the users row with a primary key = 1 */ )\n```\n\n## Numbers, bigint, numeric\n\n`Number` in javascript is only able to represent 2<sup>53</sup>-1 safely which means that types in PostgreSQLs like `bigint` and `numeric` won't fit into `Number`.\n\nSince Node.js v10.4 we can use [`BigInt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) to match the PostgreSQL type `bigint` which is returned for eg. `count(*)`. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with `JSON.stringify` out of the box, so Postgres.js will return it as a string.\n\nIf you want to use `BigInt` you can add this custom type:\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres({\n  types: {\n    bigint: postgres.BigInt\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThere is currently no guaranteed way to handle `numeric` / `decimal` types in native Javascript. **These [and similar] types will be returned as a `string`**. The best way in this case is to use  [custom types](#custom-types).\n\n## Result Array\n\nThe `Result` Array returned from queries is a custom array allowing for easy destructuring or passing on directly to JSON.stringify or general Array usage. It includes the following properties.\n\n### .count\n\nThe `count` property is the number of affected rows returned by the database. This is useful for insert, update and delete operations to know the number of rows since .length will be 0 in these cases if not using `RETURNING ...`.\n\n### .command\n\nThe `command` run by the query - eg. one of `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`\n\n### .columns\n\nThe `columns` returned by the query useful to determine types, or map to the result values when using `.values()`\n\n```js\n{\n  name  : String,    // Column name,\n  type  : oid,       // PostgreSQL oid column type\n  parser: Function   // The function used by Postgres.js for parsing\n}\n```\n\n### .statement\n\nThe `statement` contains information about the statement implicitly created by Postgres.js.\n\n```js\n{\n  name    : String,  // The auto generated statement name\n  string  : String,  // The actual query string executed\n  types   : [oid],   // An array of oid expected as input parameters\n  columns : [Column] // Array of columns - same as Result.columns\n}\n```\n\n### .state\n\nThis is the state `{ pid, secret }` of the connection that executed the query.\n\n## Connection details\n\n### All Postgres options\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres('postgres://username:password@host:port/database', {\n  host                 : '',            // Postgres ip address[es] or domain name[s]\n  port                 : 5432,          // Postgres server port[s]\n  path                 : '',            // unix socket path (usually '/tmp')\n  database             : '',            // Name of database to connect to\n  username             : '',            // Username of database user\n  password             : '',            // Password of database user\n  ssl                  : false,         // true, prefer, require, tls.connect options\n  max                  : 10,            // Max number of connections\n  max_lifetime         : null,          // Max lifetime in seconds (more info below)\n  idle_timeout         : 0,             // Idle connection timeout in seconds\n  connect_timeout      : 30,            // Connect timeout in seconds\n  prepare              : true,          // Automatic creation of prepared statements\n  types                : [],            // Array of custom types, see more below\n  onnotice             : fn,            // Default console.log, set false to silence NOTICE\n  onparameter          : fn,            // (key, value) when server param change\n  debug                : fn,            // Is called with (connection, query, params, types)\n  socket               : fn,            // fn returning custom socket to use\n  transform            : {\n    undefined          : undefined,     // Transforms undefined values (eg. to null)\n    column             : fn,            // Transforms incoming column names\n    value              : fn,            // Transforms incoming row values\n    row                : fn             // Transforms entire rows\n  },\n  connection           : {\n    application_name   : 'postgres.js', // Default application_name\n    ...                                 // Other connection parameters, see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html\n  },\n  target_session_attrs : null,          // Use 'read-write' with multiple hosts to\n                                        // ensure only connecting to primary\n  fetch_types          : true,          // Automatically fetches types on connect\n                                        // on initial connection.\n})\n```\n\nNote that `max_lifetime = 60 * (30 + Math.random() * 30)` by default. This resolves to an interval between 45 and 90 minutes to optimize for the benefits of prepared statements **and** working nicely with Linux's OOM killer.\n\n### Dynamic passwords\n\nWhen clients need to use alternative authentication schemes such as access tokens or connections to databases with rotating passwords, provide either a synchronous or asynchronous function that will resolve the dynamic password value at connection time.\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres(url, {\n  // Other connection config\n  ...\n  // Password function for the database user\n  password : async () => await signer.getAuthToken(),\n})\n```\n\n### SSL\n\nAlthough [vulnerable to MITM attacks](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/229297/174913), a common configuration for the `ssl` option for some cloud providers is to set `rejectUnauthorized` to `false` (if `NODE_ENV` is `production`):\n\n```js\nconst sql =\n  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'\n    ? // \"Unless you're using a Private or Shield Heroku Postgres database, Heroku Postgres does not currently support verifiable certificates\"\n      // https://help.heroku.com/3DELT3RK/why-can-t-my-third-party-utility-connect-to-heroku-postgres-with-ssl\n      postgres({ ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } })\n    : postgres()\n```\n\nFor more information regarding `ssl` with `postgres`, check out the [Node.js documentation for tls](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/tls.html#new-tlstlssocketsocket-options).\n\n\n### Multi-host connections - High Availability (HA)\n\nMultiple connection strings can be passed to `postgres()` in the form of `postgres('postgres://localhost:5432,localhost:5433', ...)`. This works the same as native the `psql` command. Read more at [multiple host URIs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-MULTIPLE-HOSTS).\n\nConnections will be attempted in order of the specified hosts/ports. On a successful connection, all retries will be reset. This ensures that hosts can come up and down seamlessly.\n\nIf you specify `target_session_attrs: 'primary'` or `PGTARGETSESSIONATTRS=primary` Postgres.js will only connect to the primary host, allowing for zero downtime failovers.\n\n### The Connection Pool\n\nConnections are created lazily once a query is created. This means that simply doing const `sql = postgres(...)` won't have any effect other than instantiating a new `sql` instance.\n\n> No connection will be made until a query is made.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres() // no connections are opened\n\nawait sql`...` // one connection is now opened\nawait sql`...` // previous opened connection is reused\n\n// two connections are opened now\nawait Promise.all([\n  sql`...`,\n  sql`...`\n])\n```\n\n> When there are high amount of concurrent queries, `postgres` will open as many connections as needed up until `max` number of connections is reached. By default `max` is 10. This can be changed by setting `max` in the `postgres()` call. Example - `postgres('connectionURL', { max: 20 })`.\n\nThis means that we get a much simpler story for error handling and reconnections. Queries will be sent over the wire immediately on the next available connection in the pool. Connections are automatically taken out of the pool if you start a transaction using `sql.begin()`, and automatically returned to the pool once your transaction is done.\n\nAny query which was already sent over the wire will be rejected if the connection is lost. It'll automatically defer to the error handling you have for that query, and since connections are lazy it'll automatically try to reconnect the next time a query is made. The benefit of this is no weird generic \"onerror\" handler that tries to get things back to normal, and also simpler application code since you don't have to handle errors out of context.\n\nThere are no guarantees about queries executing in order unless using a transaction with `sql.begin()` or setting `max: 1`. Of course doing a series of queries, one awaiting the other will work as expected, but that's just due to the nature of js async/promise handling, so it's not necessary for this library to be concerned with ordering.\n\nSince this library automatically creates prepared statements, it also has a default max lifetime for connections to prevent memory bloat on the database itself. This is a random interval for each connection between 45 and 90 minutes. This allows multiple connections to independently come up and down without affecting the service.\n\n### Connection timeout\n\nBy default, connections will not close until `.end()` is called. However, it may be useful to have them close automatically when:\n\n- re-instantiating multiple ` sql`` ` instances\n- using Postgres.js in a Serverless environment (Lambda, etc.)\n- using Postgres.js with a database service that automatically closes connections after some time (see [`ECONNRESET` issue](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/issues/179))\n\nThis can be done using the `idle_timeout` or `max_lifetime` options. These configuration options specify the number of seconds to wait before automatically closing an idle connection and the maximum time a connection can exist, respectively.\n\nFor example, to close a connection that has either been idle for 20 seconds or existed for more than 30 minutes:\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres({\n  idle_timeout: 20,\n  max_lifetime: 60 * 30\n})\n```\n\n### Cloudflare Workers support\n\nPostgres.js has built-in support for the [TCP socket API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/) in Cloudflare Workers, which is [on-track](https://github.com/wintercg/proposal-sockets-api) to be standardized and adopted in Node.js and other JavaScript runtimes, such as Deno.\n\nYou can use Postgres.js directly in a Worker, or to benefit from connection pooling and query caching, via the [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/learning/connect-to-postgres/#driver-examples) service available to Workers by passing the Hyperdrive `connectionString` when creating a new `postgres` client as follows:\n\n```ts\n// Requires Postgres.js 3.4.0 or later\nimport postgres from 'postgres'\n\ninterface Env {\n    HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;\n}\n\nexport default async fetch(req: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {\n    // The Postgres.js library accepts a connection string directly\n    const sql = postgres(env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString)\n    const results = await sql`SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10`\n    return Response.json(results)\n}\n```\n\nIn `wrangler.toml` you will need to enable the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag to allow Postgres.js to operate in the Workers environment:\n\n```toml\ncompatibility_flags = [\"nodejs_compat\"]\n```\n\n### Auto fetching of array types\n\nPostgres.js will automatically fetch table/array-type information when it first connects to a database.\n\nIf you have revoked access to `pg_catalog` this feature will no longer work and will need to be disabled.\n\nYou can disable this feature by setting `fetch_types` to `false`.\n\n### Environmental variables\n\nIt is also possible to connect to the database without a connection string or any options. Postgres.js will fall back to the common environment variables used by `psql` as in the table below:\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres()\n```\n\n| Option            | Environment Variables    |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------ |\n| `host`            | `PGHOST`                 |\n| `port`            | `PGPORT`                 |\n| `database`        | `PGDATABASE`             |\n| `username`        | `PGUSERNAME` or `PGUSER` |\n| `password`        | `PGPASSWORD`             |\n| `idle_timeout`    | `PGIDLE_TIMEOUT`         |\n| `connect_timeout` | `PGCONNECT_TIMEOUT`      |\n\n### Prepared statements\n\nPrepared statements will automatically be created for any queries where it can be inferred that the query is static. This can be disabled by using the `prepare: false` option. For instance — this is useful when [using PGBouncer in `transaction mode`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/issues/93#issuecomment-656290493).\n\n## Custom Types\n\nYou can add ergonomic support for custom types, or simply use `sql.typed(value, type)` inline, where type is the PostgreSQL `oid` for the type and the correctly serialized string. _(`oid` values for types can be found in the `pg_catalog.pg_type` table.)_\n\nAdding Query helpers is the cleanest approach which can be done like this:\n\n```js\nconst sql = postgres({\n  types: {\n    rect: {\n      // The pg_types oid to pass to the db along with the serialized value.\n      to        : 1337,\n\n      // An array of pg_types oids to handle when parsing values coming from the db.\n      from      : [1337],\n\n      //Function that transform values before sending them to the db.\n      serialize : ({ x, y, width, height }) => [x, y, width, height],\n\n      // Function that transforms values coming from the db.\n      parse     : ([x, y, width, height]) => { x, y, width, height }\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n// Now you can use sql.typed.rect() as specified above\nconst [custom] = await sql`\n  insert into rectangles (\n    name,\n    rect\n  ) values (\n    'wat',\n    ${ sql.typed.rect({ x: 13, y: 37, width: 42, height: 80 }) }\n  )\n  returning *\n`\n\n// custom = { name: 'wat', rect: { x: 13, y: 37, width: 42, height: 80 } }\n\n```\n\n### Custom socket\n\nEasily do in-process ssh tunneling to your database by providing a custom socket for Postgres.js to use. The function (optionally async) must return a socket-like duplex stream.\n\nHere's a sample using [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2)\n\n```js\nimport ssh2 from 'ssh2'\n\nconst sql = postgres({\n  ...options,\n  socket: ({ host: [host], port: [port] }) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const ssh = new ssh2.Client()\n    ssh\n    .on('error', reject)\n    .on('ready', () =>\n      ssh.forwardOut('127.0.0.1', 12345, host, port,\n        (err, socket) => err ? reject(err) : resolve(socket)\n      )\n    )\n    .connect(sshOptions)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Teardown / Cleanup\n\nTo ensure proper teardown and cleanup on server restarts use `await sql.end()` before `process.exit()`.\n\nCalling `sql.end()` will reject new queries and return a Promise which resolves when all queries are finished and the underlying connections are closed. If a `{ timeout }` option is provided any pending queries will be rejected once the timeout (in seconds) is reached and the connections will be destroyed.\n\n#### Sample shutdown using [Prexit](https://github.com/porsager/prexit)\n\n```js\nimport prexit from 'prexit'\n\nprexit(async () => {\n  await sql.end({ timeout: 5 })\n  await new Promise(r => server.close(r))\n})\n```\n\n## Reserving connections\n\n### `await sql.reserve()`\n\nThe `reserve` method pulls out a connection from the pool, and returns a client that wraps the single connection. This can be used for running queries on an isolated connection.\n\n```ts\nconst reserved = await sql.reserve()\nawait reserved`select * from users`\nawait reserved.release()\n```\n\n### `reserved.release()`\n\nOnce you have finished with the reserved connection, call `release` to add it back to the pool.\n\n## Error handling\n\nErrors are all thrown to related queries and never globally. Errors coming from database itself are always in the [native Postgres format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html), and the same goes for any [Node.js errors](https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors) eg. coming from the underlying connection.\n\nQuery errors will contain a stored error with the origin of the query to aid in tracing errors.\n\nQuery errors will also contain the `query` string and the `parameters`. These are not enumerable to avoid accidentally leaking confidential information in logs. To log these it is required to specifically access `error.query` and `error.parameters`, or set `debug: true` in options.\n\nThere are also the following errors specifically for this library.\n\n##### UNSAFE_TRANSACTION\n> Only use sql.begin or max: 1\n\nTo ensure statements in a transaction runs on the same connection (which is required for them to run inside the transaction), you must use [`sql.begin(...)`](#transactions) or only allow a single connection in options (`max: 1`).\n\n##### UNDEFINED_VALUE\n> Undefined values are not allowed\n\nPostgres.js won't accept `undefined` as values in tagged template queries since it becomes ambiguous what to do with the value. If you want to set something to null, use `null` explicitly.\n\n##### MESSAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED\n> X (X) is not supported\n\nWhenever a message is received from Postgres which is not supported by this library. Feel free to file an issue if you think something is missing.\n\n##### MAX_PARAMETERS_EXCEEDED\n> Max number of parameters (65534) exceeded\n\nThe postgres protocol doesn't allow more than 65534 (16bit) parameters. If you run into this issue there are various workarounds such as using `sql([...])` to escape values instead of passing them as parameters.\n\n##### SASL_SIGNATURE_MISMATCH\n> Message type X not supported\n\nWhen using SASL authentication the server responds with a signature at the end of the authentication flow which needs to match the one on the client. This is to avoid [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). If you receive this error the connection was canceled because the server did not reply with the expected signature.\n\n##### NOT_TAGGED_CALL\n> Query not called as a tagged template literal\n\nMaking queries has to be done using the sql function as a [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates). This is to ensure parameters are serialized and passed to Postgres as query parameters with correct types and to avoid SQL injection.\n\n##### AUTH_TYPE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED\n> Auth type X not implemented\n\nPostgres supports many different authentication types. This one is not supported.\n\n##### CONNECTION_CLOSED\n> write CONNECTION_CLOSED host:port\n\nThis error is thrown if the connection was closed without an error. This should not happen during normal operations, so please create an issue if this was unexpected.\n\n##### CONNECTION_ENDED\n> write CONNECTION_ENDED host:port\n\nThis error is thrown if the user has called [`sql.end()`](#teardown--cleanup) and performed a query afterward.\n\n##### CONNECTION_DESTROYED\n> write CONNECTION_DESTROYED host:port\n\nThis error is thrown for any queries that were pending when the timeout to [`sql.end({ timeout: X })`](#teardown--cleanup) was reached.\n\n##### CONNECTION_CONNECT_TIMEOUT\n> write CONNECTION_CONNECT_TIMEOUT host:port\n\nThis error is thrown if the startup phase of the connection (tcp, protocol negotiation, and auth) took more than the default 30 seconds or what was specified using `connect_timeout` or `PGCONNECT_TIMEOUT`.\n\n## TypeScript support\n\n`postgres` has TypeScript support. You can pass a row list type for your queries in this way:\n```ts\ninterface User {\n  id: number\n  name: string\n}\n\nconst users = await sql<User[]>`SELECT * FROM users`\nusers[0].id // ok => number\nusers[1].name // ok => string\nusers[0].invalid // fails: `invalid` does not exists on `User`\n```\n\nHowever, be sure to check the array length to avoid accessing properties of `undefined` rows:\n```ts\nconst users = await sql<User[]>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`\nif (!users.length)\n  throw new Error('Not found')\nreturn users[0]\n```\n\nYou can also prefer destructuring when you only care about a fixed number of rows.\nIn this case, we recommend you to prefer using tuples to handle `undefined` properly:\n```ts\nconst [user]: [User?] = await sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`\nif (!user) // => User | undefined\n  throw new Error('Not found')\nreturn user // => User\n\n// NOTE:\nconst [first, second]: [User?] = await sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}` // fails: `second` does not exist on `[User?]`\nconst [first, second] = await sql<[User?]>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}` // don't fail : `second: User | undefined`\n```\n\nWe do our best to type all the public API, however types are not always updated when features are added or changed. Feel free to open an issue if you have trouble with types.\n\n## Migration tools\n\nPostgres.js doesn't come with any migration solution since it's way out of scope, but here are some modules that support Postgres.js for migrations:\n\n- https://github.com/porsager/postgres-shift\n- https://github.com/lukeed/ley\n- https://github.com/JAForbes/pgmg\n\n## Thank you\n\nA really big thank you to [@JAForbes](https://twitter.com/jmsfbs) who introduced me to Postgres and still holds my hand navigating all the great opportunities we have.\n\nThanks to [@ACXgit](https://twitter.com/andreacoiutti) for initial tests and dogfooding.\n\nAlso thanks to [Ryan Dahl](https://github.com/ry) for letting me have the `postgres` npm package name.",

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n    replaced with your own identifying information.
